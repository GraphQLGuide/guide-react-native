## The GraphQL Guide React Native app

This example app is built, tutorial-style, in the React Native chapter of [The GraphQL Guide](https://graphql.guide/).

- Entry point: [App.js](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/master/App.js)
- Two screens, each with a GraphQL query:
  - [src/HomeScreen.js](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/master/src/HomeScreen.js)
  - [src/ChapterScreen.js](https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native/blob/master/src/ChapterScreen.js)

### Running the app

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GraphQLGuide/guide-react-native.git
cd guide-react-native/
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the Expo bundler, and you can open the app on Android, iOS, or web.
